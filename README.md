# Fake-Bank
This is a web page that simulates a bank account. I made it following a course of Udemy of Jonas Schmedtmann about Javascript.

In the page you can find 4 accounts: 
        1) User: ta Pin:1111
        2) User: jd Pin: 2222
        3) User: stw Pin: 3333
        4) User: ss Pin: 4444.

The user 1 has your timezone, in my case is ARG.
The user 2 has the timezone in English (United States)
The user 3 has the timezone in Hindi (India)
The user 2 has the timezone in Japanese (Japan)

I wish you could explore all the things on this page. If you notice any errors, don't hesitate to tell me.
